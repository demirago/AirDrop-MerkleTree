## PROJECT GENERAL SUMMARY

We were able to perform airdrops in 2 ways. First of all, we were able to exclude token holding wallets and send bulk to these addresses with a MultiSender contract.

Secondly, we keep the token holding addresses out of the contract, add these wallet addresses to the contract we created and deploy the contract. Then, the airdrop rights holders can claim the airdrop defined for their rights on the interface we have created. Each wallet can only claim once. Only defined addresses can join the airdrob.
